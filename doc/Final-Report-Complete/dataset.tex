\label{sec:data}
  In the filed of speech/speaker recognition, there are some research oriented
  corpus, but most of them are expensive. \cite{database} gives a detailed list on the
  popular speech corpus for speech/speaker recognition. In this system,
  we mainly use the speech corpus provided by our teacher Xu.

	The dataset provided comprised of 102 speaker, in which 60 are
	females and the rest are males.
    The dataset contains three different speaking style: Spontaneous,
	Reading and Whisper. Some simple statistics are as follows:
	\begin{table}[!ht]
