\section{Introduction}
	In this project, we are to build a \textbf{speaker recognition} system with
	high accuracy, along with a graphic user interface.

	Here, we defined the problem of \textbf{speaker recognition} as follows,
	which comprised of several steps:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Enrollment} \\
			A person to be recognized later must be enrolled first. The enrollment
			is conducted by recording serveral seconds of a person's voice.
			The system will then do further process to model the person's characteristics.

		\item \textbf{Recognition} \\
			A short utterance (typically 3s-5s) of the person to be recognized should
			be recorded. The utterance is feed to the system, and the system will identify
			the person who is speaking, and give the result.

	\end{itemize}
