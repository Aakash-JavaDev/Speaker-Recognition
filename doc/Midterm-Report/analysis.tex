\section{Analysis}
	The result indicates the effectiveness of our method, but also shows the limitation.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The performance is not satisfying. \\
			Compare to the performance given in serval sources (books and papers),
			ours are not the best.  This may due to the corpus difference between
			test, and the result may not be comparable.
			But comparing to MFCC extractor provided by
			bob\cite{bob2012}, we get $5\%$ higher accuracy, which proved the
			effectiveness of our model.
		\item Long training utterance. \\
			30s utterance training data may not feasible in practical application.
		\item GMM is of low efficiency when classifying. \\
			Due to the modeling of each spkeaker using GMM with 32 mixtures,
			classification of a single speaker involves scoring over all
			enrolled speakers. The more speaker, the less efficiency.
	\end{enumerate}
