\section{Future Work}
In the following two weeks, we plan to:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Compare performance with other algorithms on the same corpus.\\
		Comparison is of importance since it gives us vital feedback on our approach.
	\item Reduce test utterance length. \\
		5s utterance after VAD can be reduced to make our approach more applicable.
	\item Employ GMM-UBM to get more accurate GMM model.
	\item understanding JFA.
	\item Extend our method to open set recognition.
	\item GUI functional design.
\end{enumerate}

Moreover, we've proposed some other methods which need futher investigation:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item using Bootstraped-Multi-GMM to convey more information.
\end{enumerate}
