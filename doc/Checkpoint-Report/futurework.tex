\section{Next Step}

Our proposed way to workaround the situation mentioned in previous chapter is using
supervector-based approaches. This is advantageous since it map a speech to a single
vector, which makes it easy to utilizes discrimitive models that are more powerful
in classification task, such as SVM. Further more,
we plan to conduct extensive investigation on \textbf{Joint Factor Analysis(JFA)}
, which is a much promising method to our best knowledge extent.
