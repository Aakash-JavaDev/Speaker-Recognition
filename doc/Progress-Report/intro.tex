\section{Introduction}

In this week, we've done some fundamental work on the speaker recognition task, and gained
some valuable result. Our present work consists of the following part:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Simple implementation of a small speaker recognition program, using MFCC and GMM.

  \item Manage to get and preprocess the MOCHA-TIMIT corpus database.

  \item Test the performance of our algorithm.
\end{enumerate}
